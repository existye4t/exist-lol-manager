//! One pass of every rule over one project.
//!
//! A run lists each layer's files, hands them to each rule and collects what
//! the rules report. A rule that throws does not take the run with it: a
//! project with one unreadable `.bin` still gets every problem in the other
//! forty, and the panel names the file it could not read.
//!
//! Where those files are is [`LayerFiles`]'s business alone. A project's are a
//! directory, and an archive's are the archive - read where it lies, never
//! unpacked. Everything above [`LayerSource`] is written once for both.
