//! `bin/property-type` - a property whose declared type the game has changed.
//!
//! A property bin holds typed values. A `String` is a length and its bytes. A
//! `File` is a `u64`, the XXH64 of the lowercased path, and it is how the game
//! addresses a WAD chunk without carrying the path. Riot changed several
//! hundred properties from the first to the second, and a mod that ships the
//! old type is a mod the game rejects. The value is not wrong. Its type is.
//!
//! Two sources answer, and they answer different questions - `Lookup::of` holds
//! which one wins where. For each object the rule looks up the class hash, and
//! for each property it holds it looks up the field hash. What counts as a
//! mismatch then depends on which source answered.
//!
//! A table names both the type a property had and the type it has now:
//!
//! | The property's kind | The rule                                         |
//! | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
//! | Matches `from`      | Raises a problem                                 |
//! | Matches `to`        | Raises nothing. The file is fixed already        |
//! | Matches neither     | Raises nothing, and the file keeps what it holds |
//! | Absent              | Raises nothing. A bin declares what it declares  |
//!
//! Those four rows are what keep a run against a table idempotent, so a fix run
//! can be offered twice without doubling anything.
//!
//! The schema names only what a property should be, so it has no `from` side to
//! miss and raises whatever the old type was. The `from` side of such a finding
//! is read back off the value in `derived`, and a pair with no conversion
//! between them reports without offering a repair.
//!
//! A property whose old value is already a hash - a `Hash`, which is FNV1a32
//! of a path - has no arithmetic road to the XXH64 the game wants, so its
//! repair goes through the path: `binhashes` and the game hashtables, mimir's
//! and the mod's own, resolve the hash back to its path, and the path is
//! rehashed under the new function. A hash no table resolves is the one
//! finding this rule cannot repair.
//!
//! The walk descends into `Struct` and `Embedded` values, because those carry a
//! class hash of their own and two rows of the table key on one.
