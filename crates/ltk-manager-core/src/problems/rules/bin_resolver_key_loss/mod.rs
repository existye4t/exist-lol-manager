//! `bin/resolver-key-loss` - a resolver defining far fewer keys than the
//! game's.
//!
//! A skin's `SkinCharacterDataProperties` points at a `ResourceResolver`, whose
//! `resourceMap` maps the generic name a spell script asks for onto that skin's
//! own effect. Bin objects are substituted by path hash rather than merged, so
//! a mod shipping its own skin bin replaces the game's resolver outright, and
//! every key the mod's copy does not carry is a key nothing answers.
//!
//! The shape this catches is one skin's resolver cloned into every slot: the
//! same handful of keys repeated per skin, where the game's copy holds that
//! skin's own set. One measured mod dropped 1,151 keys across 75 resolvers.
//!
//! **A miss does not crash, so this reports at `Info`.** Effect-key resolution
//! walks its tiers, and on total failure it logs the key that resolved to
//! nothing and substitutes a placeholder effect - which it then resolves
//! through the same last-resort tier. The one assert on that path is compiled
//! out of a retail build. So what a lost resource costs is the effect rather
//! than the process, and a mod that gives every skin one look drops these on
//! purpose: the rule cannot tell that apart from an accident, which is what
//! makes this worth knowing rather than something wrong.
//!
//! Two refusals keep the count honest:
//!
//! - **A raw difference is an upper bound on a defect, not a count of one.** A
//!   mod that deliberately collapses every skin onto one look drops per-skin
//!   keys on purpose and is reported all the same. That is why the finding says
//!   what the two counts are rather than naming a number of faults, and why
//!   `LOST_AT_LEAST` keeps the small edits out.
//! - **The rule offers no repair, because a repair is the wrong instrument.**
//!   The keys only exist in the installed game, and ADR-0012 puts reading them
//!   in the overlay build rather than in the mod file - recomputed every build,
//!   so nothing bakes to one patch and nothing is written to a file that keeps
//!   no copy of what it was.
