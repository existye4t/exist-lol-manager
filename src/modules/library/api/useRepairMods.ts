 * reported twice over. A surface that only needs to start one takes the action
 * from whoever mounted this.
 *
 * The progress is returned rather than narrated, so the surface that owns the
 * run draws it where the run is happening. The outcome stays a toast: by then
 * the surface it belongs to has usually emptied itself and gone.
 *
 * The backend records each mod's fresh verdict as it goes, so the badges follow
 * from refetching the verdicts rather than from anything this reports.
