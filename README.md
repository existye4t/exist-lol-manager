## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10 or 11** (64-bit). macOS and Linux support is planned.
- **League of Legends** — a valid game installation.

### Installation

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/ltk-manager/releases/latest).
2. Download the `.msi` installer (recommended) or the NSIS `.exe` installer.
3. Run the installer and launch **LTK Manager**.
4. On first launch, the app will attempt to auto-detect your League of Legends installation. If it can't find it, you'll be prompted to select the game folder manually.

### Installing Mods

1. Download a mod in `.modpkg` or `.fantome` format from your preferred source.
2. Drag and drop the file onto the LTK Manager window, or use the install button.
3. Enable the mod in your library and click **Run** to start the patcher.

## ⚖️ License & Reuse

LTK Manager is open-source under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Releases up to and including v1.15.2 were dual-licensed MIT / Apache-2.0 and remain available under those terms.

### LTK Patcher Binaries

This application bundles the LTK patcher binaries (`ltk_patcher_host.exe` and `ltk_patcher_dll.dll`), which perform the actual game injection. They are governed by the [LTK Patcher License](LTK-PATCHER-LICENSE.md).

The short version, if you want to reuse them in your own launcher or tool:

1. You are free to use, study, modify, and redistribute them.
2. Official builds are code-signed by League Toolkit. Unless we've explicitly permitted it, you may not ship them under our signature — strip it, and if you sign, sign with your own certificate.
3. Whatever you distribute is on your name: if it gets a code-signing certificate flagged or banned, that certificate must be yours, not ours.

For full terms, see [LTK-PATCHER-LICENSE.md](LTK-PATCHER-LICENSE.md).
